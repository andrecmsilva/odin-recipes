    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Carbonara is made with guanciale (<em>cured pork</em>), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of black pepper. 
    <p>Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!</p>
